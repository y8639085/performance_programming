This directory contains a simple molecular dynamics (MD) code

The program implements:

    long range inverse square forces between particles. F = G * m1*m2 / r**2
    viscosity term     F = -u V

If 2 particles approach closer than Size we flip the direction of the
interaction force to approximate a collision.

Coordinates are relative to a large central mass and the entire system is moving relative to the
viscous media.

This program was developed as part of a code optimisation course
and is therefore deliberately inefficient.

The code is available in C and Fortran. You only need to work with one version 
of the code.

The program reads input.dat and writes output.dat.

The directory Test contains source of a program to compare output.dat files.
It will only report differences above a preset tolerance value.
